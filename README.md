This package does histogram binning on a unit sphere, i.e. binning of unit vectors. It also provides some plotting utilities.

Binning a single vector takes on the order of `30ns`.

Here's an example plot. The left side shows a histogram of 1e6 random unit vectors, sampled correctly. The right side shows `normalize(2rand(3) .- 1.0)`, also one million samples.
